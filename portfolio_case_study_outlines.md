## Case Study #1: Trust by Design

**Suggested Portfolio Title:** *"Trust by Design: How a Workshop for 60 People Became a CHI 2026 Paper on Bias"*

**Why this title works:** It signals scale (60 people), ambition (CHI), and intellectual surprise (bias twist). A hiring manager reads this and thinks: "this person doesn't just execute — they reflect."

**Storytelling Approach:** Freytag's dramatic arc. This is your "movie" case study — it has a hero's journey structure with a genuine plot twist.

---

### THE HOOK (Above the Fold)

> "We designed a flawless workshop. The participants loved it. The prototypes were impressive. And the insights were wrong."

Lead with the paradox. Following the inverted pyramid principle, give the reader the most interesting conclusion first — that "real" users can sometimes produce less authentic data than AI personas — then pull them into the story of how you got there.

**Result banner (visible before scrolling):**
- 60 participants, full-day design thinking workshop
- 6 AI personas built from ~70 in-depth interviews
- CHI 2026 position paper accepted
- Self-initiated project (not assigned by management)

---

### ACT 1: EXPOSITION — "Nobody Asked Us To"

**The Setup (keep this tight — 2-3 paragraphs max)**

The business context: Fibabanka was developing a wealth management app with AI-powered investment guidance. The team needed to understand what value proposition would resonate with real investors.

The initiative: You and Onur Yılmaz (ex-Userspots) weren't assigned to run this workshop. You volunteered. You walked into the office and "put your hand under the stone" — a Turkish expression for taking initiative. This detail matters because it shows leadership and ownership, not task completion.

**What to show here:**
- A photo or visual of you and Onur planning (if available)
- The initial scope: planned for 40, grew to 60 (frame this as a challenge you adapted to, not just a number)
- Your role: co-designer of the entire workshop methodology

---

### ACT 2: RISING ACTION — "Building the Machine"

This section is about your methodological craft. Break it into clear phases:

**Phase 1: The AI Personas**
- Built from ~70 in-depth interviews across wealth segments
- Transformed from static documents into conversational AI agents (CustomGPT)
- Each persona configured with demographics, financial goals, pain points, behavioral patterns
- *Show:* a redacted persona card or the CustomGPT configuration logic
- *Mention:* organizational resistance to AI persona adoption — this sets up the tension for later

**Phase 2: Workshop Design**
- The structured interview protocol you designed (the 5-question / 5-minute UX interview set)
- Map each question to the empathy map quadrant it serves:
  - Q1 (Context) → Does/Says
  - Q2 (Goals) → Thinks
  - Q3 (Challenges) → Feels + Does
  - Q4 (Needs) → Thinks + Says
  - Q5 (Emotion moments) → Feels
- *Show:* the interview framework as a visual (translate key elements to English for portfolio)
- *This demonstrates:* you don't just ask questions — you engineer them with intent

**Phase 3: Workshop Execution Flow**
Present the full-day arc visually (a timeline or journey map of the workshop itself):

1. Onboarding & introductions
2. Rules & design thinking fundamentals
3. Real-life persona presentations (actual customers matching your persona profiles)
4. Empathy mapping sessions with live participants
5. Journey mapping
6. Lunch break
7. Affinity clustering
8. Idea generation + "investment" exercise (you designed the money!)
9. To-be journey creation
10. AI-assisted prototyping (Creatie, UIzard)
11. Group presentations with prototypes

- *Show:* photos from the workshop, the physical empathy maps, the "money" you designed
- *Highlight:* your role as facilitator helping groups build prototypes with AI tools

### ACT 3: THE CLIMAX — "The Bias We Didn't See Coming"

This is where your case study becomes extraordinary. Most portfolios end at "we ran the workshop and here are the insights." Yours goes deeper.

**The uncomfortable discovery:**
- Three of five table groups produced answers indicating high dependency on existing portfolio manager (PM) relationships
- "I would follow him wherever he goes" — real quotes
- Questions about digital alternatives were consistently deflected toward human touch
- All three of those tables had PMs physically present and participating

**Name the biases explicitly (this shows analytical rigor):**
- **Social desirability bias** — PMs were sitting right there; criticizing human advisors would be socially awkward
- **Context effects** — luxury hotel setting positioned participants as valued guests, not critical evaluators
- **Relational anchoring** — participants were literally asked to imagine losing someone sitting beside them
- **Acquiescence bias** — the hospitable environment encouraged agreement

**The key insight (make this visually prominent):**
> "Our AI personas, built from 70 interviews in neutral settings — homes, coffee shops, phone calls — contained less contextual contamination than what we obtained from carefully recruited human participants."

---

### ACT 4: FALLING ACTION — "From Failure to Framework"

- You and Ilgın Şafak analyzed why this happened
- You moved beyond "AI vs. Human" to understanding which biases each approach introduces
- You proposed that AI personas aren't unbiased — they have *different* biases (training data, sycophancy, hallucination) — but they can't be influenced by stakeholder presence, hospitality, or relationship pressure
- This thinking became a position paper submitted to CHI 2026

**What to show:**
- A diagram comparing bias types: Human Participant Biases vs. AI Persona Biases
- The paper title and abstract (abbreviated)

---

### ACT 5: RESOLUTION — "What I Learned"

Don't just list learnings. Frame them as principles you now carry:

1. **"Authenticity is contextual."** Real users expressing real values in biased contexts still produce biased data. Context always shapes expression.
2. **"The validation paradox."** If we validate AI personas against human responses, but human responses are contaminated — what's our ground truth?
3. **"Initiative creates opportunity."** This workshop wasn't assigned. The CHI paper wasn't planned. Both happened because you stepped up.

**Close with what's next:** Open questions from the paper — positioning yourself as someone who's still thinking, not someone who has all the answers.

---

### VISUAL & MEDIA STRATEGY FOR THIS CASE STUDY

- Workshop photos (blurred faces if needed)
- The empathy map template you designed
- The "investment money" you created
- AI persona cards (redacted)
- A before/after diagram: "What we expected to learn" vs. "What we actually learned"
- CHI 2026 paper citation as a credibility anchor

## Case Study #2: AlışGidiş — Going Undercover in the Field

**Suggested Portfolio Title:** *"I Went Undercover at 4 Stores to Find Out Why 70% of Our Customers Never Come Back"*

**Why this title works:** It's personal ("I"), action-oriented ("went undercover"), specific ("4 stores, 70%"), and immediately raises a question in the reader's mind. It doesn't sound like a corporate case study — it sounds like a story someone would actually want to read.

**Storytelling Approach:** Investigative journalism / gonzo research. This is your "detective" case study. Unlike Trust by Design (which is reflective and meta), this one is visceral, street-level, and scrappy. The reader should feel like they're in the store with you.

---

### THE HOOK (Above the Fold)

> "46% of Fibabanka's new customers were coming through one channel — Vatan Bilgisayar electronics stores. And almost all of them were leaving after paying off their first loan. I grabbed my ID, walked into a store, and bought AirPods on credit to find out why."

**Result banner:**
- 4 store visits across Istanbul (Kadıköy, Esenkent/Piazza AVM, Maltepe, Acıbadem, Bostancı)
- 3 visits undercover as customer, 2 as Fibabanka employee
- Identified 4 critical trust breakdowns in the BNPL journey
- Delivered actionable recommendations for education, transparency, UX, and process efficiency

---

### SECTION 1: THE BUSINESS PROBLEM — "Our Biggest Channel Was Also Our Biggest Leak"

Keep this data-driven and punchy. Use the actual numbers from your research presentation:

- **46.19%** of Fibabanka's customer acquisition came through Vatan Bilgisayar alone
- ~**70%** of all customers came through shopping credits (BNPL) across all retail partners
- **51%** of customers discovered Fibabanka *during* a purchase — not before
- Yet these customers were churning after paying their loans — never engaging with other banking products

**The core question:**
> "If most customers meet us at the cash register, what is that first impression actually like?"

**What to show:** The pie chart from your research presentation (customer acquisition breakdown) — this is a powerful visual that immediately communicates the business stakes.

---

### SECTION 2: THE METHOD — "Role Play Rule Set"

This is what makes your case study unique. You didn't send a survey. You didn't run a usability test. You created a covert research protocol and went into the field yourself.

**Explain the methodology:**
- You designed a "Role Play Rule Set" — essentially an undercover research script
- Rules included: pick a product over 10,000 TL, ask technical questions first to build rapport, gradually steer toward credit options, observe how the sales rep reacts
- Two research modes: visiting as a customer (3 visits) and as a Fibabanka employee (2 visits) — this triangulation was intentional
- Backup cover story ready in case you were discovered

**Why this matters for your portfolio:**
This shows a hiring manager that you don't just follow established methods — you invent methods when the situation calls for it. Guerrilla field research in fintech is rare and memorable.

**What to show:** The role play rule set document (translate key points), your selfie from the field (this humanizes the research — you were really there)

---

### SECTION 3: THE EXPERIENCE — "What It Feels Like to Be Our Customer"

This is the heart of the case study. Tell it chronologically, store by store, in first person. Use short paragraphs and real dialogue. Make the reader feel the awkwardness, the confusion, the loss of control.

**Store 1: Kadıköy Vatan Computer (July 24, 17:00)**
- You asked about AirPods Pro (8,150 TL)
- The sales rep mentioned the BNPL sticker on the door but warned about 14% interest with life insurance
- The rep essentially discouraged the product they were supposed to sell
- Key quote (translated): *"It's mostly used for phones, because credit card installments don't work for those. The interest is high for 6 months with AlışGidiş."*

**Store 2: Piazza AVM Esenkent (July 25, 20:40)**
- You asked about payment options
- The rep offered credit card installments first, never mentioned BNPL proactively
- When you specifically asked about the AlışGidiş sticker, the rep showed reluctance
- A brief silence followed — then the rep eventually engaged

**Store 3: The Full Purchase Experience**
- You went through the entire BNPL process — applied, got approved (85,000 TL limit), bought the AirPods
- Critical finding: **you never held your own phone during the entire process.** The sales rep took your phone, entered your password, navigated the app, scrolled through contracts, and completed everything on their end
- The rep even called a colleague for a "code" they needed
- You walked out with AirPods but feeling *güvensiz* (insecure/untrusting)

> "Throughout this process, I felt deeply insecure. I kept questioning whether I should have used a different method."

**What to show:** Photos from each visit, the promotional stickers, the receipt, your selfie with the AirPods (already in your report)

---

### SECTION 4: THE FINDINGS — "Four Trust Breakdowns"

Synthesize your store-by-store observations into clear, named findings. This transforms raw experience into actionable insight.

**1. The Anti-Recommendation Problem**
Store employees actively discouraged AlışGidiş because of high interest rates and long processing times. The bank's own acquisition channel was being undermined by the people supposed to promote it.

**2. The Invisible Product Problem**
BNPL was never offered proactively. Even though promotional banners covered the storefront, sales reps defaulted to credit card installments. Customers who didn't already know about AlışGidiş would never discover it.

**3. The Lost Control Problem**
During the application process, the customer's phone is taken by the sales rep. The customer watches passively while a stranger navigates their banking app, enters passwords, and approves contracts. This creates fundamental trust erosion at the very first touchpoint.

**4. The Knowledge Gap Problem**
Sales reps lacked clear, accurate information about AlışGidiş terms. Interest rates were quoted inconsistently. One rep said 14%, another said 44% — the speed of the second answer "made me think twice." The bank's own representatives couldn't represent the product.

**What to show:** A 2x2 matrix or visual framework organizing these four breakdowns

---

### SECTION 5: RECOMMENDATIONS — "What I Proposed"

Present your recommendations tied directly to each finding:

| Finding | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Anti-Recommendation | Sales training program + aligned incentives for store reps |
| Invisible Product | Redesign in-store touchpoints; make BNPL the default suggestion |
| Lost Control | Redesign the mobile application flow so customers can self-serve in-store |
| Knowledge Gap | Create clear, simple reference materials for sales reps with accurate rates |

---

### SECTION 6: REFLECTION — "What This Taught Me"

1. **"The best research sometimes means becoming the user."** Lab settings can't replicate the social dynamics, time pressure, and emotional weight of a real purchase decision.
2. **"First impressions compound."** When 70% of your customers meet you through a broken experience, you don't have a retention problem — you have an onboarding problem.
3. **"Data tells you what; the field tells you why."** The churn numbers were available to everyone. It took going into the store to understand the human reasons behind them.

---

### VISUAL & MEDIA STRATEGY FOR THIS CASE STUDY

- The customer acquisition pie chart (data credibility)
- Store visit photos (you were there — show it)
- The role play rule set (methodological rigor)
- The promotional stickers vs. the actual experience (visual contrast)
- Your selfie with the AirPods receipt (personal, human, memorable)
- A service blueprint or journey map of the BNPL experience showing pain points
- Before/after: "What the bank thinks the experience is" vs. "What it actually is"

## Key Differences Between These Two Outlines

| Dimension | Trust by Design | AlışGidiş Field Research |
|---|---|---|
| **Scale** | 60 people, full-day workshop | 1 researcher, 4 store visits |
| **Tone** | Strategic, reflective, academic | Street-level, visceral, personal |
| **Narrative type** | Dramatic arc with plot twist | Investigative journalism |
| **What it proves** | You question methodology itself | You get out of the building |
| **Unique strength** | Leads to CHI 2026 paper | Guerrilla / undercover research |
| **Hiring manager takeaway** | "This person thinks deeply" | "This person takes action" |

These two case studies complement each other perfectly. Together they show both strategic thinking and tactical execution — exactly what a mid-level researcher with 2+ years should demonstrate.
